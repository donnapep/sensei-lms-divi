Edit and style Sensei LMS elements using the Divi Builder.

== Description ==

Sensei LMS Modules for Divi empowers you to utilize the power of Divi to add, remove, and style Sensei LMS elements that make up a course or lesson page layout so that you can create completely custom pages from scratch. No more having to resort to external CSS or modifying page templates with custom code.

Sensei LMS modules currently include:
* Course Title
* Course Description
* Lesson Title
* Lesson Description

If there are additional modules you would like to see added, please request them in the support forum.

= How Sensei LMS Modules Work =
Sensei LMS Modules work in much the same way as dynamic content already works within the Divi Builder. Each Sensei LMS Module requires you to select a course or lesson in order to generate dynamic content. The dynamic content is pulled from the database and includes the information that you entered when setting up your course or lesson. You can then use the Divi Builder settings to style the dynamic content just as you would for any other Divi module.

= Accessing Sensei LMS Modules from the Divi Builder =
Sensei LMS Modules are accessible from within the Divi Builder just as with regular Divi Modules.

Once the Divi theme has been installed on your website, you will notice a _Use The Divi Builder_ button above the post editor every time you are building a new post or page. Clicking this button will enable the Divi Builder, giving you access to all of the Divi Builderâ€™s modules including Sensei LMS Modules.
